Hypermine
=========
This project aims to be a minecraft-like game which is based on an order 4 dodecahedral grid in hyperbolic space rather than the usual
cubic grid. At present, it's just a representation for points in hyperbolic space and functions for measuring the distance and angles between
them.

The next functions to be added will be either a representation of "straight lines" or some kind of equivalent to vector addition.
